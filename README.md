# About
Just a repo I made with implementations of various data structures in CPP.   
Please fork the repo to enhace the code or fix any bugs.   
The code has been tested in Ubuntu 18.04.

# Dependencies
The project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) for unit testing.   
Not hard dependencies but makes thing easier.   
The preferred, but not required, IDE is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## VSCode Extensions
- [C/C++ Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
- [CMake Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twxs.cmake)
- [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vector-of-bool.cmake-tools)

You may need to restart VSCode for all extensions to work properly
